    "The original dataset obtained from Kaggle.com contained the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    
    "Animal ID, Name, DateTime, OutcomeType, OutcomeSubtype, AnimalType, SexuponOutcome, AgeuponOutcome, Breed, and Color.  \n",
    "\n",
    
    "Animal ID is a unique identifier given to every animal that enters a shelter.  For the purpose of statistical analysis, the Animal ID's do not provide valuable information and will not be included or used. \n",
    "\n",
    
    "Name is an ordinal attribute with 6374 different names represented in the dataset.  To deal with the large number of names present the data was transformed to become Has_Name where a 0 represents having a name and a 1 indicates no name. \n",
    "\n",
    
    "DateTime is a temporal attribute which denotes the time at which an animal was admitted to a shelter.  \n",
    "\n",
    
    "OutcomeType is a nominal attribute with 5 categories: Return_to_owner, Euthanasia, Adoption, Transfer, and Died. \n",
    "\n",
    
    "OutcomeSubtype is a nominal attribute with 16 categories.  These categories are varied as well as missing for roughly half of the dataset.  Therefore this attribute will be dropped from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    
    "AnimalType is a nominal attribute with 2 categories: Cat and Dog. \n",
    "\n",
    
    "SexuponOutcome is a nominal attribute with 5 categories: Neutered Male, Intact Male, Spayed Female, Intact Female, and Unknown.  This attribute was transformed into two attributes: Is_Intact and Gender each with two categories. \n",
    "\n",
    
    "AgeuponOutcome is an ordinal attribute with 44 \"categories\", or different ages that were reported for animals going into the shelter.  This attribute was tackled two ways.  The first attempt was to convert it into a continuous variable using an ageMap to have all AgeuponOutcome data represented as days.  Visualization of this conversion revealed that it was unsuccessful, as the data were not continuous.  The solution we settled on was to reconvert the data back into an ordinal attribute with 3 categories: young (1 year or younger), adult (between 1 and 8 years old), and senior (older than 8 years).  \n",
    "\n",
    
    "Breed is an ordinal attribute with 1380 categories that represent different breeds of both dogs and cats.  This attribute was split into a few additional attributes: Is_Aggressive, Is_Popular and Size.  Is_Agressive was created using a list of the top 10 aggressive dog breeds from www.therichest.com.  Any dog breeds on the list were represented by a 1, all other dogs and cats were represented by a 0.  Is_Popular was created using a list from www.petinsurance.com that contains the ten most popular dog breeds .  If an animal was on this list, it was given a 1, everything else was given a 0.  Size is a nominal attribute with 4 categories: Small (weight <= 20 lbs), Medium (between 21 and 65 lbs), Large(between 66 and 100 lbs), and Giant (>100 lbs).  These sizes were obtained from the American Kennel Club's list of dog breeds and sizes.  All cats were determined to be of size Small.  \n",
    "\n",
    
    "Color is an ordinal attribute with 366 categories that represent the different colors of the animals entering the shelter.  To simplify the large amount of colors a new attribute Primary_Color was created.  Primary_Color is an attribute with 4 categories: Exotic, Dark, Neutral, and Light.  The colors that each category represents were determined arbitrarily.\n"
