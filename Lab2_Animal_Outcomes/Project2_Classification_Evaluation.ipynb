    "Millions of animal companions end up in shelters each year in the United States. These animals may be stray, rescued from a difficult situation or given up by their previous families. Each year, roughly 40 percent of all dogs and cats in shelters are euthanized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset comes from the Austin Animal Center in Austin, Texas and is part of a Kaggle competition. Using this data, we hope to find trends or rule sets identifying the outcomes of animals in shelters. The findings would subsequently drive shelter practices, hopefully for more social good than business good. For instance, if spaying or neutering a dog or cat is highly suggestive of a favorable outcome for an animal, shelters should implement policies ensuring all animals are fixed prior to adoption. This practice may cost the shelter more money, but would improve the welfare of the animal population. Further, could something as simple as giving each an animal a name drive a more favorable outcome? This particular practice would cost nothing but time and in turn improve the welfare of the animal population in cities. Cost savings, however, could be gained from our analysis. For instance, it may be easy enough to automate intake and processes for certain breeds or genders of animals while focusing attention on breeds or genders of animals that the data indicate \"need more help.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to use the 27 thousand records in the training set as a reference for other major cities in the United States, where most animal shelter practices are similar from an intake and outcome perspective. Our dataset includes statistics on breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success should be categorized into analytical and business goals. Analytical goals would be based on classification accuracy on a sizeable test data set given by a confusin matrix where overall classification accuracy is greater than 85% at minimum with at least 85% precision. Further, and possibly more importantly, we hope our analysis drives at least a 20% decrease in animal euthanizations and transfers combined over a two calendar year period.  \n"

    "\n",
    "**============================**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanatory features in our dataset are made up of AnimalID, Name, DateTime, AnimalType, SexuponOutcome, AgeuponOutcome, Breed and Color. Perusing the data at a high level, we can easily see that there are many opportunities to split the data into valuable, new features which will help train our classification algorithm more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "AnimalID is a unique identifier given to every animal that enters a shelter. For the purpose of statistical analysis, the Animal ID's or substring of the animal ID does not provide valuable information and will be removed from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Name is a nominal feature with 6374 different names represented in the dataset. This feature may be valuable from a classification standpoint: does a pet being named increase the chances of adoption? The most frequent animal name in our dataset is 'Max.'\n",
    "\n",
    "DateTime is a temporal feature which denotes the time at which an outcome occurred. In particular, this attribute is useful from a data analysis standpoint only. For instance, do euthanizations occur at a particular point during the day? However, from a classification standpoint, we do not expect this feature to be valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "AnimalType is a nominal feature with two levels: Cat and Dog. This feature will likely be a critical feature for classification and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "SexuponOutcome is a nominal categorical feature with five levels: Neutered Male, Intact Male, Spayed Female, Intact Female, and Unknown. This attribute can easily be split into separate nominal features indcating if an animal is fixed and the gender of the animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "AgeuponOutcome is an ordinal feature with 44 levels, or different ages that were reported for animals upon outcome. In order to normalize this feature, we will attempt to convert AgeuponOutcome into days. Examples of levels in this feature include: 1 year, 15 days, 7 months. Each level begins with an integer in every case. The most frequent level is '1 year.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Breed is a nominal categorical feature with 1380 levels that represent different breeds for both dogs and cats. Breed holds generic levels such as \"domestic shorthair\" for dogs, which may indicate an inability to truly determine the breed type. We will need to be cognizant of this fact when training our classification model. This feature holds many opportunities for simplification and feature creation and transformation. For instance, we can identify breeds with a 'reputation', size of the animal and popular breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, color is another nominal categorical feature with 366 level that represent the different combination colors of the animals entering the shelter. An example of a level of Color is \"Brown/White,\" with the first color representing the primary color of the animal. Due to the number of levels in the Color feature, aggregation of the levels of color will be needed to effectively train our classification algorithm and derive business impact. "

Therefore, we have retrieved the American Kennel Club's (http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/) listing of breeds and associated sizes. Because there are so few toy breeds listed, we combined toy and small into \"small.\" For breeds that were not represented in AKC's list (there were about 20), each  was mapped to size buckets based on the following logic: Small (avg weight <= 20 lbs ), Medium (<= 65 lbs), Large (<= 100 lbs), Giant (> 100 lbs). All cats were mapped to \"small.\" We expect the size feature to be more relevant for dogs, and we expect it to be significant. We've also added in an indicator for the top 10 most popular dogs."

    "Some interesting discoveries come out of simple percentages: for instance, most animals being adopted are small. This is likely because cats are also categorized into the small category -- we will explore animal type crosstabs more thoroughly. Most critically, adoption rates show promise: 40 percent of all animals are adopted. Our business partners are looking to increase this number. Further, given Austin's policy of no euthanizations unless aggressive or sick, it's easy to see that most animals do indeed survive, however, most are transferred to other shelters. Transfers come with high cost for our business partners. This is likely a metric they'd like to reduce. The more an animal is passed through the system, the larger emotional detriment and the higher cost for the shelters in managing input/output as well as standard medical treatment, room and board and surgical operations. Further, it looks as though the most popular breeds are not present in the sample of shelter animals, which could be a bad sign for future adoptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these charts, we also likely can combine size into a three level factor feature by combining giant into large since it is about 2% of the dataset. Further, most animals are dark colored and fixed. Fixed animals make up almost 75% of the dataset while dark colored animals are 40% of the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, there are more dogs than cats in our dataset. This is actually a surprise, given that stray cats are far more frequently encountered than stray dogs. "

Specifically, looking at the second chart, over 90 percent of adopted animals are fixed. Given the moderate association found for Is_Intact, this is a critical datapoint discovered for our classification purposes going forward. Further, the majority of animals that perished were intact. This could be due to pre-existing conditions coming into the facility."

    "\n",
    "The logistic regression and the linear support vector models offer very similar results in terms accuracy of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "While logistic regression was relatively quick, using SVM with the linear kernel was very slow, so we opted instead to use a version of linear SVM that employed stochastic gradient descent. With this approach, even 1000 itereations of SGD were performed quickly, proving much more efficient but building a model with the same accuracy as the regular linear SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both logistic regression and linear SVM have the benefit that the coefficients of the features provide meaningful insight into the logic of the model, and are interpretable as the relative weights (either positive or negative) that each feature has on the prediction of adoption.\n",
    "\n",
    "While SVM using the RBF kernel provides better overall accuracy, it sacrifices the ability to leverage the coefficients of the support vector to derive any direct interpretability of relative weight of the individual features within the RBF model.\n"
