Some even claim to be optimized for farmers or other niche categories part of what we can call the \"dating universe.\" With millions of people utilizing online dating services, it is only natural then to optimize a recommendation system for users to easily find optimal matches or dates."

    "Recommender systems normally utilize a set of items or users and items, along with optional features as part of a linear model to predict ratings or calculate similarities between items. Our training set contains a user id, another user that was rated by our user id and a rating or score. This is an interesting dilemma, often not common to recommenders for music or movies. In our case, we essentially have created a user-user matrix. There is an obvious relationship between the users doing the rating and the users being rated which may imply an item-item (user-user) recommender be used. We will investigate multiple recommender models to determine which works the best.\n",

This percentage works out to about 13,500 users, however, we'll round up to 14,000. From each of these users, we'll pull 20% of their ratings for our test set and retain the rest of the 80% for training.

    "Our first attempt at creating a more robust recommender will be a Ranked Factorization Matrix. Since we have explicit data with ratings included in our observations, we can do one of two things with matrix factorization:\n",

    "The RankingFactorizationRecommender in GraphLab tries to recommend items that are both similar to the items in a user's dataset and, if rating information is provided, those that would be rated highly by the user. The trade off with this recommender is that we will likely have less predictive accuracy but better precision and recall. This is due to the fact that the ranking method penalizes the predicted rating of items that are significantly different from the items a user has already interacted with. This ensures the model is confident in its prediction AND it predicts a high rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In factorization models in general, users and items are represented by weights and factors learned during model training where weights or bias terms account for a user or item's bias towards high or low ratings. An item rated high consistently would have a higher weight coefficient, for instance. There are also latent factor terms that model interactions between users and items and allow us to group users and items into categories. If a user loves romance movies and hates action movies, factor terms attempt to capture that relationship and use the model to predict lower scores for action movies and higher scores for romance movies.\n",

    "Weights and latent factors are learned via stochastic gradient descent and solving for the minimization of multiple user/item bias variables, side data variables and latent variables of a complex objective function not listed here. Randomization is often incorporated, especially in the case of finding latent variables where we have missing ratings and want to predict what the user score would be.\n",
