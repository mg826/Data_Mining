    "Millions of animal companions end up in shelters each year in the United States. These animals may be stray, rescued from a difficult situation or given up by their previous families. Each year, roughly 40 percent of all dogs and cats in shelters are euthanized. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset comes from the Austin Animal Center in Austin, Texas and is part of a Kaggle competition. Using this data, we hope to find trends or rule sets identifying the outcomes of animals in shelters. The findings would subsequently drive shelter practices, hopefully for more social good than business good. For instance, if spaying or neutering a dog or cat is highly suggestive of a favorable outcome for an animal, shelters should implement policies ensuring all animals are fixed prior to adoption. This practice may cost the shelter more money, but would improve the welfare of the animal population. Further, could something as simple as giving each an animal a name drive a more favorable outcome? This particular practice would cost nothing but time and in turn improve the welfare of the animal population in cities. Cost savings, however, could be gained from our analysis. For instance, it may be easy enough to automate intake and processes for certain breeds or genders of animals while focusing attention on breeds or genders of animals that the data indicate \"need more help.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to use the 27 thousand records in the training set as a reference for other major cities in the United States, where most animal shelter practices are similar from an intake and outcome perspective. Our dataset includes statistics on breed, color, sex, and age from the Austin Animal Center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success should be categorized into analytical and business goals. Analytical goals would be based on classification accuracy on a sizeable test data set given by a confusin matrix where overall classification accuracy is greater than 85% at minimum with at least 85% precision. Further, and possibly more importantly, we hope our analysis drives at least a 20% decrease in animal euthanizations over a two calendar year period.  \n"

    "The explanatory features in our dataset are made up of AnimalID, Name, DateTime, AnimalType, SexuponOutcome, AgeuponOutcome, Breed and Color. Perusing the data at a high level, we can easily see that there are many opportunities to split the data into valuable, new features which will help train our classification algorithm more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal ID is a unique identifier given to every animal that enters a shelter. For the purpose of statistical analysis, the Animal ID's or substring of the animal ID does not provide valuable information and will be removed from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Name is a nominal attribute with 6374 different names represented in the dataset. This particular attribute may be valuable from a classification standpoint: does a pet being named increase the chances of adoption?\n",
    "\n",
    "DateTime is a temporal attribute which denotes the time at which the outcome occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "AnimalType is a nominal attribute with 2 categories: Cat and Dog and represents a critical analysis point and classification explanatory feature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "SexuponOutcome is a nominal attribute with 5 categories: Neutered Male, Intact Male, Spayed Female, Intact Female, and Unknown. This attribute can easily be split into separate nominal features indcating if an animal is fixed and the gender of the animal. \n",
    "\n",
    "AgeuponOutcome is an ordinal attribute with 44 levels, or different ages that were reported for animals upon outcome. In order to normalize this feature, we will attempt to convert AgeuponOutcome into days. Examples of levels in this feature include: 1 year, 15 days, 7 months. Each level begins with an integer in every case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breed is an ordinal attribute with 1380 categories that represent different breeds of both dogs and cats. Breed holds generic levels such as \"domestic shorthair\" for dogs, which may indicate an inability to truly determine the breed type. We will need to be cognizant of this fact when training our classification model. This attribute holds many opportunities for simplification and feature creation and transformation. For instance, we can identify breeds with a 'reputation', size of the animal and popular breeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, color is an ordinal attribute with 366 categories that represent the different combination colors of the animals entering the shelter. An example of a level of Color is \"Brown/White,\" with the first color representing the primary color of the animal. Due to the number of levels in the Color feature, aggregation of the levels of color will be needed to effectively train our classification algorithm and derive business impact. "

    "Some interesting discoveries come out of simple percentages: for instance, most animals being adopted are small. This is likely because cats are also categorized into the small category -- we will explore animal type crosstabs more thoroughly. Most critically, adoption rates show promise: 40 percent of all animals are adopted. Our business partners are looking to increase this number. Further, given Austin's policy of no euthanizations unless aggressive or sick, it's easy to see that most animals do indeed survive, however, most are transferred to other shelters. Transfers come with high cost for our business partners. This is likely a metric they'd like to reduce. The more an animal is passed through the system, the larger emotional detriment and the higher cost for the shelters in managing input/output as well as standard medical treatment, room and board and surgical operations. Further, it looks as though the most popular breeds are not present in the sample of shelter animals, which could be a bad sign for future adoptability.\n",

    "Based on these charts, we also likely can combine size into a three level factor feature by combining giant into large since it is about 2% of the dataset. Further, most animals are dark colored and fixed. Fixed animals make up almost 75% of the dataset while dark colored animals are 40% of the sample size.\n",

Most of the other categorical variables are either weakly or moderately associated with outcome. Of the variables, Is_Intact, age_range, has_name and Type would be our best predictors.
